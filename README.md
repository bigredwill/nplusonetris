It's Tetris but every line you clear makes the pieces bigger.

_The best game you've ever played or your money back!_

### To build
This project was built on a pretty old version of NodeJS (v12.16.1) and Grunt (v0.4.5). Maybe it'll work with newer versions too? Regardless, building should be relatively straightforward:

```
npm install
grunt
```

The built project will be found in dist/build.js. There are no real dependencies, it's all vanilla.
